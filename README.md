This application is being developed for educational purposes. I want to improve my skills and knowledge in development.

Besides, application is developed using the UIKit (no storyboard) framework programmatically.  
SDK & Frameworks: Swift5, Design Patterns, OOP, UIKit, MVVM architecture, Core Data, SnapKit, Networking.

Application development is divided into 14 parts:
1) Get Started. Setup environment. Delete storyboard. Create the MainTaBBarViewController with 4 UINavigationController.
2) UITableView & UICollectionView
3) UITableHeaderView. SnapKit packages were installed and used instead of NSLayoutConstraints
4) UINavigationBar for HeaderView & Section titles for each tableView sections were set up.
