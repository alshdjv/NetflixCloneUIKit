This application is being developed for educational purposes. I want to improve my skills and knowledge in development.  
I configured some of the codes and structures in my personal views.

Besides, application is developed using the UIKit (no storyboard) framework programmatically.  
SDK & Frameworks: Swift5, Design Patterns, OOP, UIKit, MVVM-C architecture, Core Data, SnapKit, Networking, SDWebImage, GCD

Application development is divided into 14 parts:
1) Get Started. Setup environment. Delete storyboard. Create the MainTaBBarViewController with 4 UINavigationController.
